<h1>The Best Movies according to Pratik</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>An absolute masterpiece. Classical Drama at it's peak, It shows in order to make a great movie you don't need expensive budget</p>
<br />
<h3>The Dark Knight Returns</h3>
<p> This is my favourite animation movie of all time. As an already batman fan, I thought nothing could make me even more fan of this character. But this movie made me believe why Batman is the Greatest superhero of all time</p>
<br />
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>In my opinion this movie is still underrated, the first time I watched it I didn't realize what was so special about it. Seemed like a straightforward movie with a simple plain plot. But then when I connected the dots, made 2+2=4 and realized the proper analogy of the movie, My mind was just blown away</p>
